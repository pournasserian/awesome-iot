## Tools

* [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) - Tool to visualize your MQTT topics in a topic hierarchy, a MQTT swiss-army knife.

## Platforms

* [**Thinger.io**](https://github.com/thinger-io) - Thinger offers a ready to go scalable cloud infrastructure for connecting millions of devices. You can control them with our easy to use admin console, or integrate them in your business logic with our REST API.
* [United Manufacturing Hub](https://github.com/united-manufacturing-hub/united-manufacturing-hub) - The Open-Source Manufacturing App Platform (combines various open source solutions and packages them in a Helm chart, for example nodered, VerneMQ and timescaleDB)
* [Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte) - Astarte is an Open Source IoT platform written in Elixir. It is a turnkey solution which packs in everything you need for connecting a device fleet to a set of remote applications. It performs data modeling, automated data reduction, real-time events, and provides you with any feature you might expect in a modern IoT platform. Right now, Linux and ESP32 devices are supported out of the box using the provided SDKs.
* [**Blynk**](https://blynk.io/) - Blynk is a platform for creating iOS and Android apps for connected things. You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets (right on the smartphone). Supports Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM/GPRS, USB/Serial connections with wide range of prototyping platforms from Arduino, Raspberry, ARM mbed, Particle, RedBear, etc.
* [Iotivity](https://iotivity.org/) - IoTivity is an open source software framework enabling seamless device-to-device connectivity to address the emerging needs of the Internet of Things.
* [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) - The openHAB runtime is a set of OSGi bundles deployed on an OSGi framework (Equinox). It is therefore a pure Java solution and needs a JVM to run. Being based on OSGi, it provides a highly modular architecture, which even allows adding and removing functionality during runtime without stopping the service.
* [**Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/) - Awaken your home, Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi or a local server.
